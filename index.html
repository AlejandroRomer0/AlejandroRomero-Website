        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a mechanical engineering student at the University of California, Riverside. I originally had interest in civil engineering and planned on eventually transferring to a school which offered civil engineering. I soon realized that mechanical engineering was also able to offer what interested me in civil engineering. I am glad I continued in this major, since it introduced me to a broad range of engineering sciences which were all fascinating to learn about.<br><br>

        My current expected graduation date is June 2022. I will be graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering. The GPA I currently have is a 3.70. My concentration will be in Materials and Structures. The concentration requires a total of 16 units, the equivalent of 4 classes. The classes which helped expand my knowledge in Materials and Structures was: Failure Analysis and Prevention, Microstructural Transformation of Materials, Mechanical Behavior of Materials, and Vibrations. I also did undergraduate research. For research I was tasked with researching the mechanical and thermal properties of drywall and developing tests which would help characterize these properties. By doing this, I would be able to use these tests to also characterize the properties of drywall alternatives that may be developed. I have focused on developing and performing nail pull resistance and hardness tests. Both are mechanical tests. I also helped develop a thermal test to characterize the thermal conductivity of drywall for my senior design project. While at UCR, I was able to become a certified Solidworks Associate in Mechanical Design and a certified Solidworks Associate for Simulation.

        I have been working as an engineering intern for a construction company. At this company, I have been tasked with preparing the layout of building foundations and concrete-related site work using Civil 3D. I have also prepared design surfaces for precise grading of the project using Civil 3D. By doing this work, I have been responsible for checking accuracy and feasibility of specifications provided by the engineering firm that designed the project for concrete related work. If specifications are not accurate or feasible, I would be tasked with requesting extra information and making sure that the work can be done. I have also had some exposure to preparing shop drawings. I work closely with the employees who are working on site, and as a result I have improved my communication skills. While working as an engineering intern, I have been able to expand my knowledge and skill using Civil 3D. Because of calculations I have had to do for both my internship and for my coursework, I have also become familiar with using Excel for mathematical calculations. I have also been exposed to Tekla, which is a type of BIM Software which aims at making accurate 3D representations of the 2D designs developed using Civil 3D or Autocad. This may make conflicts which are not noticeable through 2D sketches or through elevations much more obvious. By handling plans and sketches, I have also been exposed to Adobe Acrobat Pro and some of the features that it has to offer.
